This is a repository for a Python automation program that sorts my downloaded files from the downloads folder into the respective type folders each file should belong.

This makes it easier for me to sort through files and to move them from one place to the other.

Note that I am using an external hard drive so I added a situation wherein if I were unable to access my external hard drive, the files in my downloads folder will be sorted into the downloads directory instead.

To use the python script, open the script and modify the download_folder and destination_folder to be the path of your download directory and the directory where you want to store the files, respectively.

Editing the file_types dictionary will allow you to customize which directories should exist and which files are to be segregated into them.
